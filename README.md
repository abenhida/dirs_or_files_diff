# dirs_or_files_diff
I quickly put this as I came to need to compare 2 directories to find out if there are files that have been added or deleted from either directories, report the diffenece in filenames, and compares the files that both directories have in common and report if the content of any has changed or not.

When running the program, the user is prompted to chose to compare either 2 files or 2 directories.
also as a note when run, provide the path escaping the "\" character, example: C:\\Users\\Username\\Desktop\\tests
